Making the Code

To make the file, go to the ~/src/OpenHRP3.0/Controller/IOserver/plugin/forceSensorPlugin_Juan/server directory and type: 
“make ROBOT=HRP2STEP1”

Cleaning the Code
To clean the code you can simply run: 
“make clean”

Enabling/Disabling Debugging
To enable debugging you nead to open the following Makefile: ~/src/OpenHRP3.0/Controller/IOserver/plugin/forceSensorPlugin_Juan/server/Makefile

Under the “Compile Commands”section of the code, comment or uncomment the following line:
“CXX_FLAGS += -g -Wall -O0”

Enabling/Disabling Simulation
To enable debugging you nead to open the following Makefile: ~/src/OpenHRP3.0/Controller/IOserver/plugin/forceSensorPlugin_Juan/server/Makefile

Under the “Compile Commands”section of the code, include or remove the -D flag for Simulation:
CXX_FLAGS += -DPIVOTAPPROACH  -DSIMULATION #-DIMPEDANCE 

Enabling/Disabling Simulation
